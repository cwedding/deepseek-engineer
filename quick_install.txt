Resolve the virtual environment path mismatch:

    Deactivate Any Active Virtual Environment

deactivate

    Navigate to Your Project Directory

cd "/Volumes/T9/Desktop Core/deepseek-engineer"

    Create a New Virtual Environment

python3 -m venv .venv

    Activate the Virtual Environment

source .venv/bin/activate

    Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run Your Application

uv run main.py

    Notes:

    Ensure that you're using the correct Python version compatible with your project.
    If you continue to encounter issues with the uv command, verify that it's installed and properly configured in your virtual environment.
   
  pip install uv 
   
    If uv refers to a specific tool or script, make sure it's correctly referenced in your project setup.
    By following these steps, you should be able to set up and activate the appropriate virtual environment for your project without path conflicts.
